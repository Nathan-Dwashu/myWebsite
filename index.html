The product was announced under the name “Play Station” in May 1991 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in a corporation with Nintendo. After that partnership fell apart, Sony went on to release a console of its own.

                        Sony’s approach to third-party developers was a big part of the PlayStation success. By the end of 1996, almost 400 games were being developed for the PlayStation, while 200 and 60 games for the Saturn and the Nintendo 64. A wild variety of games were offered for the original PlayStation over its 11-year run and some of the best-selling games of PlayStation are Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy VII, Crash Bandicoot, and Tekken 3.

The original version was released alongside the console on December 3, 1994. Besides the console and controller, the memory cards were valuable back then for saving your game progress, and they came out in a total of 1 megabyte. Sony released a few peripherals for the console such as a PlayStation mouse, an Analog Joystick and a Link Cable to connect two consoles to play compatible multiplayer games on separate consoles.

                    <h4>Playstation 3 (2006)</h4>
                    <img src="https://altarofgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/playstation-3-2009-all-playstation-consoles-altar-of-gaming.jpg.webp" width="35%"/>

                        The console was first officially announced at E3 2005 and was released at the end of 2006. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including the PlayStation Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console, through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita.

The best selling games are Grand Theft Auto V, The Last of Us, Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception.
                        
                        During its early years, the system was receiving negative reviews, due to its high price, $599 for a 60-gigabyte model and $499 for a 20 GB model. A big problem was also the complex processor architecture, and the lack of quality games, but that was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and “untapped potential”. The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the Slim model.

                    <!--Playstation 4-->
                    <h4>Playstation 4 (2013)</h4>
                    <img src="https://altarofgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/playstation-4-2013-all-playstation-consoles-altar-of-gaming.jpg.webp" width="35%"/>
                    <p>
                        The PlayStation 4 is the eighth-generation console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Announced in February 2013 the critics were praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers’ needs, embracing independent game development, and not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One.
                        <br><br>
                        The console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can peak at 1.84 teraflops. AMD stated that it was the most powerful APU it had developed to date. Its optical drive is capable of reading Blu-ray Discs at speeds of up to three times that of its predecessor. The original PS4 console can output in 4K and play multimedia in the format but does not play games in 4K resolution. The console includes a 500 GB hard drive for additional storage, which can be upgraded by the user.
                        <br><br>

The console also supports High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia. The shape of the triggers and shoulder buttons were refined, the D-pad buttons were given a steeper downward angle to provide a resting space in the center for the user’s thumb, and the handgrips were made thicker and given micro texturing to improve their feel.
                        <br><br>
                        Sadly, the PlayStation 4 is not compatible with any game of the older PlayStation consoles. PlayStation 4 games are distributed at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through the PlayStation Store.
                        <br><br>
                        PS4 allows users to access a variety of free and premium PlayStation Network services, to play online on multiplayer games, including the PlayStation Store acces, giving to its player up to three games per month for a limited time to play.

                        Last April, Sony unveiled the next-generation console, without any specific details. In August, Jim Ryan, President & CEO, announced that the next console will be called PlayStation 5, sharing also some exciting details about the new controller.
                        <br><br>
                        It features Haptic feedback that simulates touch, meaning the controller will output vibrations or movements to replicate a real-life touch experience. You will be able to even get a sense of a variety with textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud. This aims to improve the controller’s feedback and the player’s immersion.
                        <br><br>
                        The new console is expected to be released on the Holidays of 2020 (October – December), and the first official trailer for PS5 was released in June 11, 2020:
